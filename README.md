### Hi, I&rsquo;m JD 

I design tools for smart people with complicated jobs.

At the minute, I am at Spotify, working on a new metrics platform. Before that, I led design on [The Spotify Experimentation Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/10/spotifys-new-experimentation-platform-part-1/). I also contribute design to [Backstage](https://backstage.io), for instance the [Pulse](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/) plugin.
